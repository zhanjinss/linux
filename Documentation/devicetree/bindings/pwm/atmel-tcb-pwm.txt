Atmel TCB PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "atmel,tcb-pwm"
- reg: tcb channel to use. Each channel can export 2 PWMs
- #pwm-cells: should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format. The only third cell flag supported by this binding is
  PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED.

Example:

tcb0: timer@f800c000 {
	pwm@0 {
		compatible = "atmel,tcb-pwm";
		reg = <0>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
	};
};
